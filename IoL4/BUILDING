A quick and dirty guide to building IoOS/L4
Kentaro A. Kurahone (kurahone@sigusr1.org)

Since right now I've only used this on ia32, the following instructions assume
that you are building on x86.

Building:
 * Type "gmake". (I'm assuming that gmake == GNU make on your system).
 * This will go through the L4 configure process also.  Remember to enable
   the "Keyboard" option for the kernel debugger if you are not using a 
   serial line.

Booting:
 * Copy the files in ./bin to somewhere that GRUB can see them.
 * Boot with the following series of commands. (Add drive/paths as appropriate).
     kernel /boot/l4/kickstart
     module /boot/l4/ia32-kernel
     module /boot/l4/sigma0
     module /boot/l4/io
     boot
