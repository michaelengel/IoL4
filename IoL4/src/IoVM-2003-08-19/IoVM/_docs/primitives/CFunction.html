<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
A container for a pointer to a C function binding. They can only be defined from the C side. They act like blocks in that when placed in a slot, they are called when the slot is activated. The "for", "if" "while" and "clone" methods of the Lobby are examples of CFunctions. CFunctions are useful for implementing methods that require the speed of C or binding to a C library.
