- Collect MBI, MBI.mods and command line strings in one page

  For IA-32, GRUB puts the MBI, the mbi.mods table and the various
  command lines at different places in the lower 640K. These
  structures should be collected in a single page that is then to be
  marked as bootloaderspecific.

- Check for overlapping memory regions

  The memcopy function (or its invoking function) could check against
  the module memory ranges in MBI.mods.  The ELF loader updates the
  mods structure as it loads the three initial files.

  An extended version could attempt to resolve conflicts by moving
  memory around
